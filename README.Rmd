The goal of startbox is to manage and visualize experimental data in plant protection trials.

This R package was developped as part of the STAR project 2024-2027 (France), with the support of the French Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and the financial contribution of the special allocation account for agricultural and rural development (CASDAR). The responsability of the French Ministry of Agriculture and Food cannot be engaged.

## Installation

You can install the development version of startbox from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r echo = TRUE, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")  # if not already installed
devtools::install_github("vignevin/startbox")
```

If you also want to install the vignette (which serves as a tutorial for the package), run this after installation:

```{r echo = TRUE, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install(build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Once installed, you can access the vignette with:

```{r}
vignette("startbox")
```
