\description{
Exports all observation data stored in the \code{obs_data} slot of a \code{user_data} object into a new Excel file.
Existing "data_*" sheets are replaced, and new ones are added. The resulting file is saved in the Downloads folder
with an automatically generated timestamp in the filename. The function also updates the internal Excel file path
and logs all export operations in the traceability system.
