The goal of startbox is to manage and visualize experimental data in
plant protection trials.

This R package was developped as part of the STAR project 2024-2027
(France), with the support of the French Ministry of Agriculture and
Food, and the financial contribution of the special allocation account
for agricultural and rural development (CASDAR). The responsability of
the French Ministry of Agriculture and Food cannot be engaged.
